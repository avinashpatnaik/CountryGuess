# CountryGuess - a simple country guess game

This is a simple Android game that is part of my fun projects. This challenges you to come up with different country names while the OS also does the same. There is a timer setup and the player will be given a timeframe of 30 seconds within which he/she has to come up with a country name whose initial letter should start with the last letter that the opponent guesses. The sooner you guess the country's name, the more points you would get.
